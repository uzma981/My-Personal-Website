# My Personal Website

- C# ASP.Net MVC
- Database: Microsoft SQL Server.
- Quickly designed and customized the responsive site with Bootstrap.
- Brief summary of each sections of the application 👇


## 📝 To do List: 
- Database driven To do List using ASP.net
- I tend to use lists to prioritize my workload and set clear targets for myself to achieve at the end of the day. Deciding between a timetable and a to do list is always a challenge, but personally for me a to do list takes the lead. I prefer having a tick list where I can see my tasks to be completed and slowly disappearing as I scribble my way through them (the good old days) . Therefore, I wanted to apply the same concept in my personal website to use on a daily basis.
- Created:
1. ApplicationDbContext class which handles the task of connecting to the default localdb database and mapping TodoCategory objectis to the database records.
2. A new AddTodoController class -  code that retrieves the to do list data and displays it in the browser using a view template. A request to the AddTodo controller returns all the entries in the To do table and then passes the results to the Index view.
3. Index.cshtml file - used @model directive to allow access to the list of to do's that the controller passed to the view using a Model object and displayed it.
